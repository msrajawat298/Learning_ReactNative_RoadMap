## What is React Native?
- React Native is an open-source framework for building native Android and iOS applications using React
- JavaScript to access platform-specific APls (such as camera and push
notifications)
- React components to define the appearance and behavior of your user interface
- React itself is a library designed for building user interfaces
**react-dom for web apps** and **react-native for native mobile apps**.


## Why React Native?
- iOS apps requires Swift or Objective-C
- Android apps requires Java or Kotlin
- With approximately 31% on iOS and 68% on Android, you would typically need to develop two separate apps using different technologies
- With React Native, you can create an app that works seamlessly on both platforms
- Rather than assembling separate teams of iOS and Android developers, businesses can opt for a single team proficient in React Native, saving time and costs
- If the team is well-versed in React, their expertise can extend to web app development as well


## Expo vs React Native
- React Native is an open-source framework maintained by Meta (Facebook), designed for building cross-platform apps.
- Expo is an open-source framework maintained by Expo itself, designed for building cross-platform apps.
- Unlike plain RN, which can be challenging and time-consuming to set up, Expo provides a streamlined experience that's why [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) Community also recommend to use [expo](https://expo.dev/).
- Expo has a suite of tools and services built around React Native, which greatly simplifies the development process.
- With plain react native, you cannot build iOS apps on a windows or linux machine. Native iOS apps can only be built on a macOS machine.
- With Expo, you can develop your app on windows or linux and run your app on a physical iphone.

Note :  You can't generate app like apk for android for ios for testing in physical devices like android devices.
        You must have to apple developer account for run test app in ios physical devices like android devices.
        You have to pay 99$ once for apple developer account then you can test your app in ios physical devices.
