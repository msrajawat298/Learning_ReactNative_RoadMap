## Library for React Native
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
    - React Native doesn't have a built-in API for navigation like a web browser does. 
    - React Navigation provides this for you, along with the iOS and Android gestures and animations to transition between screens.
    - React Navigation is a library for routing and navigation in React Native applications. 
    - It provides a way to navigate between different screens in your app, and it also includes features like tab bars, stack navigators, and drawer navigators.
    - If you are using Expo framework then you no need to use this library you can use it directly expo router.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
    - State management libraries that help you manage the state of your application in a predictable way. Redux is more widely used, but MobX offers a simpler alternative with less boilerplate.
- [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/)
    - A UI toolkit for React Native apps that provides ready-to-use components such as buttons, cards, and input fields, which can help you build your app's UI faster.
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/example)
    - Libraries for making HTTP requests from your React Native app. Axios is a popular choice due to its simplicity and support for interceptors and response transformation.

- [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/)
- [React Native Gesture Handler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-gesture-handler)
    - If you are building a mobile app with Expo and you need to handle gestures, I recommend using React Native Gesture Handler. 
    - It provides a number of benefits over the built-in Expo touch system, and it is a popular library with a large community of users and contributors.
