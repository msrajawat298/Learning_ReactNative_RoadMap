# React Native Android Development Guide

Welcome to the React Native Android Development Guide! This guide provides essential terminologies and concepts for developing React Native applications targeting the Android platform. Whether you're new to Android development or looking to integrate native Android functionality into your React Native app, this guide will help you navigate through the Android ecosystem.

## Terminologies

### 1. Activity
An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface. In React Native, you might interact with Activities when integrating native Android components or modules.

### 2. Layouts
Android provides various layout classes to define the visual structure for user interface elements. React Native uses Flexbox for layout, but you might still need to understand Android layout concepts when customizing native components.

### 3. Manifest
The AndroidManifest.xml file describes essential information about the app to the Android system, such as permissions, hardware requirements, and app components.

### 4. Intents
Intents are messages that allow components to request functionality from other components within the Android system or other apps. In React Native, you might use Intents for interactivity between your app and other Android components or apps.

### 5. Permissions
Android apps need to request permissions to access certain device features or data. Understanding how to handle permissions is crucial when developing React Native apps for Android.

### 6. Gradle
Gradle is the build system used to compile, build, and package Android apps. React Native uses Gradle under the hood to build Android apps.

### 7. APK
The Android Package (APK) is the package file format used by the Android operating system to distribute and install mobile apps. React Native apps are packaged into APKs for distribution on the Google Play Store or other Android app stores.

### 8. Lifecycle Methods
Android apps have a specific lifecycle, including methods like onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), onStop(), and onDestroy(). While React Native abstracts some of these details, understanding Android's lifecycle can be beneficial for optimizing performance and managing resources in your app.

### 9. Native Modules
React Native allows you to write native code (Java or Kotlin) and expose it to JavaScript using Native Modules. Understanding how to create and use Native Modules is essential for integrating React Native apps with Android-specific functionality.

### 10. Debugging Tools
Android Studio and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) are essential tools for debugging React Native apps on Android devices. Familiarize yourself with these tools for troubleshooting and optimizing your app.

### 11. API level
API level is a value that represents the version of the Android framework that is available on a device. Each version of Android has a corresponding API level. For example, Android 4.0 corresponds to API level 14. When you develop an app, you can specify the minimum and target API levels to indicate the minimum version of Android your app supports and the version it's optimized for. This helps ensure your app runs properly on different versions of Android.
