**Android Development**

Welcome to the Android Development README! Here you'll find essential information and terminology to kickstart your journey in building Android applications.

### Android SDK (Software Development Kit)
Just like the JDK for Java, the Android SDK provides developers with a set of tools and libraries to create applications for the Android operating system. It includes components for development, testing, and debugging, supporting languages like Java and Kotlin.

### Android Emulator/Android Virtual Device (AVD)
The Android Emulator allows testing apps on virtual Android devices, offering various configurations for different versions and screen sizes. It's indispensable for cross-version and cross-device testing.

### Android Debug Bridge (ADB)
ADB facilitates communication between a developer's computer and an Android device or emulator. It's used for tasks such as installing and debugging apps, accessing the device shell, and file transfer.

### SDK Manager
SDK Manager, part of Android Studio, lets you download and manage different SDK versions, development tools, and system images for testing on various Android devices.

### Android NDK (Native Development Kit)
The Android NDK (Native Development Kit) is a toolset that allows developers to use native code languages like C and C++ in their Android applications. It enables developers to improve performance or reuse existing code written in these languages. The NDK provides libraries and tools for compiling and linking native code into Android applications.

### Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager
AVD Manager enables the creation and management of virtual Android devices for use with the Android Emulator. You can configure screen size, Android version, and hardware specifications.

### Android SDK Tools
These include command-line utilities, build scripts, and resources necessary for app development.

### Android SDK Build Tools
A collection of command-line tools automating the build process for Android apps, compiling code, packaging resources, and creating APK files.

### Android SDK Platform Tools
Containing platform-specific utilities like ADB and Fastboot for communication with Android devices and emulators at a lower level.

### Android Support Library (now AndroidX)
Provided backward compatibility for older Android versions and additional features for app development.

### Android API Documentation
Comprehensive documentation covering all aspects of Android development, including APIs, classes, and guides.

### APK File
The package format for distributing and installing Android apps, containing code, resources, assets, and manifest file.

### Android Tool Repository
Various repositories and tools related to Android development available on platforms like GitHub, providing rich resources for building, modifying, and enhancing Android applications.

### Dalvik Virtual Machine (DVM)
The virtual machine used in older Android versions, replaced by ART in later versions, offering improved performance and reduced memory usage.

### Manifest File
An XML file containing essential information about the app for the Android system, including permissions, components, and configuration.

### Logcat
A debugging tool for viewing and analyzing log messages generated by Android applications and the system, essential for tracking issues and understanding app behavior.

### Toast
A short alert message displayed on the Android screen for a brief period, used to provide feedback or information to the user.
